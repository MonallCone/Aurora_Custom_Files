		<description>
			<p>Growing up, the menacing presence of the Scourge loomed over your life in the city. The beasts terrified you, destroyed your homes, and took away people you loved. Driven by vengeance, fear, or a desire for justice, you chose to become a hunter. The Church, a mentor, or the Radiant Order taught you the ways of the hunt, giving you the knowledge and skills needed to defend your city and yourself. Whether you were once a simple citizen turned protector or a seasoned veteran of the First War hardened by countless battles, you have become an essential line of defense against the darkness.</p>

				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>A set of common clothes, a trophy from a beast you've slain, a hunter’s kit (includes 20 lead bullets, a silvered dagger, a flare, and a silver flask), a healer’s kit, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>

			<p>Your continuous battles against the beasts have fortified your body and mind against the horrors of the Scourge. When an aberration or beast forces you to make a saving throw against the frightened condition, you gain a bonus on saving throws equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you share a strong bond with fellow hunters, allowing you to request favors from them. </p>
