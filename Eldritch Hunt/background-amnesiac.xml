			<p>You woke up one day in the city of Luyarnha, with no memory of who you were or where you came from. You're near-certain that this place is not your home, but all the memories of your past life are a haze of indistinct shapes and sounds. Faint images, like that of a silver lake or a towering mountain, flash through your mind but they provide no concrete details of your origin. You only know that you must find the truth, at any cost.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>Insight , Investigation</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong>Common and Deep Speech</li>
                <li><strong>Tool Proficiencies</strong>One type of artisan's tools</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>A set of common clothes, a small keepsake from your forgotten past, a set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<div element="ID_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_LINGERING_ECHOES" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Your amnesia makes you a blank slate, and can make you eager to experience the world anew and desperate to reclaim your lost past. It also can make you feel adrift and disconnected from the people around you.</p>

			<p>The echoes of your lost memories sometimes surface in surprising ways. When you enter a new location or meet a new person, there's a chance something about them will trigger a faint recollection from your past. The GM might allow you to recall a small detail about the world, give you a hint about the situation at hand, or allow you to use your proficiency with a skill or tool you aren't normally proficient with for a single roll.</p>
