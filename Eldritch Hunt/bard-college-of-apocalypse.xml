            <p>Apocalypse bards are masters at conjuring forth the ancient powers of eldritch gods, summoning forth their otherworldly might to wreak havoc on the mortal realm. All who hear their aberrant harmonies fear and revere them—they understand that with a single whisper, these bards can cause the end of all things. Apocalypse bards are often found on the front lines of battle, their music serving as a rallying cry for their allies and a death knell for their enemies. With each stanza they produce, a member of the College of the Apocalypse draws closer to the ultimate revelation of the horrors that lie beyond the veil. Many fear the day when they will finally succumb to the madness that gnaws within their mind.
            
            As they progress in their studies, members of this bard college gain the ability to summon forth devastating powers with their music. They can call down swarms of pain, tear open rifts in reality, and unleash waves of madness upon their foes. They know the apocalypse is coming, for they are the ones bringing it.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you understand how to use your bardic magic to conjure forth the power of the Great Ones. You learn two Eldritch Melodies of your choice, which are detailed under "Eldritch Melodies" below. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. You can use a melody as an action, expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration. After you use a melody, you can’t use that melody again until you finish a short or long rest. If a melody requires a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. For a creature to become affected by one of your melodies, it must be able to hear you when you take the action.
                
            You learn one additional Eldritch Melody of your choice at 6th and 14th level. 
            
            When you finish a long rest, you can delve into what lies beyond the veil, replacing one or more melodies you know with another one. Each time you attempt to replace a melody, make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you lose control over your mental journey into the void; you gain one short-term madness, don’t replace that melody, and you can’t replace any other melodies until you finish a long rest. </p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, your words can call beings from beyond the veil. When a creature that possesses a Bardic Inspiration die from you is targeted by an attack, it can use its reaction to expend the die, summoning an eldritch maw that engulfs and protects it. Until the start of its next turn, it gains a bonus to its AC equal to the number rolled. If this causes the triggering attack to miss, the targeted creature can choose to be ripped through space by the maw, teleporting it to a pointwithin 30 feet of it that it can see; if it does so, it loses the bonus to its AC.</p>

You can also cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell in this way, the apocalypse flows through you; damage can't break your concentration on this spell, and you automatically succeed on the saving throws to keep control over the spell. </p>

It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be drawn through it to an unknown destination. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target isn’t an aberration, it takes 5d12 psychic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term madness.</p>

            <p>You recite forbidden lore learned from a tome of flesh, summoning forth a swarm of buzzing, entrail-eating creatures. For 1 minute, a 30-foot-radius sphere of writhing worms appears at a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is devoured by it and must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 5d6 necrotic damage and is poisoned for 1 minute on a failed save, or half as much damage and isn’t poisoned on a successful one. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On each of your turns after you summon the swarm, you can use a bonus action to move it up to 30 feet in any direction. This effect ends early if you take fire or radiant damage.</p>
