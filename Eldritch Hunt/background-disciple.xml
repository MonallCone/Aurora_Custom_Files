			<p>You have spent countless hours praying, studying scriptures, and performing rituals. Your devotion is so great that it draws the attention of the Radiant One, or so you believe. You can call upon this divine favor to guide your path. Once per day, you may ask your deity for guidance. How this guidance manifests can varyâ€”a sudden insight, a prophetic dream, or perhaps a subtlesign in the environment around you.</p>

			<p>Through your dedicated service, you have harnessed the powers of the Radiant One. In the most dire of situations, you may extract this power for a miracle. However, these miracles are not to be taken lightly and should not be used frivolously. The miracle cannot be stronger in power than a spell of level equal to half your character level (rounded down, minimum 1st level). After a miracle has been granted, your hit points maximum are lowered by an amount equal to your character level for 1d12 days, and you must perform a significant service for the Radiant One to regain this miracle. </p>

			<p>You've spent years studying the ancient scripts and texts of the Radiant Church, and with time, you've become a skilled scribe. Not only can you flawlessly replicate any scripture, but you can also identify and understand most religious texts related to your faith. This ability can prove invaluable when deciphering forgotten scriptures or understanding cryptic prophecies.</p>
