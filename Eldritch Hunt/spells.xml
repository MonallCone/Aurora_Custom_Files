        <p>You dramatically increase the pull of gravity in a 30-foot-radius, 300-foot-high cylinder centered on a point on the ground within range. Creatures in this area are knocked prone and cannot lose this condition while there. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is knocked prone and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. A flying creature in the area immediately falls to the ground and is knocked prone.</p>
        <p class="indent">A creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to move or perform any action. Each foot of movement while in the area costs a creature 3 extra feet.</p>
        <p class="indent">A prone creature that ends its turn in the cylinder must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced into the ground as gravity pulls it down. It is restrained and incapacitated by the crushing pressure and the ground around it, but it gains the benefits of three-quarters cover, as only the upper part of their body is visible. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself from the ground on a success.</p>
        <p class="indent">If the spell lasts for its full duration, the ground cracks under the tremendous weight generated and becomes difficult terrain. Each 5-foot-square area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand to remove the difficult terrain.</p>

        <p>When you cast this spell, you create a crack in the world, letting the will of a Great One smother a creature of your choice within range. The direct contact with the eldritch being causes the target to take 8d6 psychic damage, and it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is pulled in through the tear to the cosmos. On a success, it isn't pulled but gains a long-term madness, and the spell ends.</p>
        <p class="indent">While in the cosmos, the target is incapacitated. At the beginning of each of its turns while there, it takes 3d6 cold damage, 3d6 psychic damage, and must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a short-term madness.</p>
        <p class="indent">When the spell ends, if the target is still alive, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the creature is killed while in the void, its corpse never returns. A body that disappears in this way can never be recovered, not even with a wish spell.</p>
        <p class="indent">If your concentration on the spell ends early, you must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a long-term madness as the eldritch whispers revolt and assault your mind.</p>
        <p class="indent">When the spell ends, roll a d100. On a 1, the breach doesn’t close and instead only expands, threatening to absorb the entire world.</p>
