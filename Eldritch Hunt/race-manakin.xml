			<p class="flavor">With a touch of gold, a breath of lightning, and hours of meticulous welding and articulation, a manikin is ‘born’. Often called ‘marionettes’ or ‘living dolls’, these creatures were originally the creations of the Scions, a Luyarnhian sect who seek to craft a force capable of protecting the city. Though each manikin looks different—indeed, they can resemble any race— the thin golden stitching that joins the plates of their artificial skin is a giveaway that the creature is a manmade creation.</p>
            <p class="freewill"><strong><em>Free Will</em></strong>Inscribed on human eyes inside their skulls are the instructions which all manikin obey. More often than not, this includes a safety system that ensures adherence to the law and prevents a manikin turning on their master. In some cases, a crafter might even cause the manikin to feel love for their creator. Conceived as animate objects capable of carrying out the instructions, manikin who express thoughts of selfliberation are often disposed of before these thoughts turn into acts. Though the Scions intentions were initially noble, playing god has given them a taste for power and they have no intention of granting free will to their animated servants.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> As they are not alive, Manikins do not age. However, their materials slowly lose their magic essence over time, meaning they will ultimately lose control over their entire body and turn back into inanimate objects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong>Manikins can be small puppets or imposing armors. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race </p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read and write Common.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Modular Gold Plating</em></strong>Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no AC benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.
