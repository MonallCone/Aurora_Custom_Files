		<description>
			<p>You once were dead, but the mysterious Blood Moon of Rebirth returned you to life, leaving an indelible Eldritch Carving on your body - the Sacrificial Brand. The mark on your flesh is feared by many, as it is believed to attract the terrible creatures that plague the world, to you, it symbolizes the weight of your past life with you, and the promise that this life will end again, violently. Embracing your new life as a symbol of rebirth and sacrifice, you have resolved to use this opportunity, even if it leads you once again to a brutal end. </p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>Arcana, Survival</li>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong>Deep Speech</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A flare (used to indicate your position during hunts), a set of common clothes, a small knife for carving runes, a journal detailing your experiences since rebirth, and a pouch containing 10 gold pieces. The Sacrificial Brand Eldritch Carving is scarified on your body. </li>
			</ul>
			<div element="ID_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_6TH_SENSE" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>

			<p>Not only were you brought back from the dead by the Blood Moon, but you also survived the horde of beasts that were brought back with you, despite their ability to track you. Your senses are honed beyond mortal comprehension. You can sense the presence and general direction of powerful eldritch energies and artifacts within a 1-mile radius, particularly if they are connected to the Blood Moon of Rebirth or the Mother of a Thousand Young. </p>
