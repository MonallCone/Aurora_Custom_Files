		<description>
			<p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a clericâ€”performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p>
			<p class="indent">Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>Arcana or Religion and Persuasion or Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong>Choose one between Deep Speech, Infernal and Sylvan, reflecting the cult to which you belonged</li>
                <li><strong>Tool Proficiencies</strong>One type of artisan's tools</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>A set of common clothes, a brimmed cloak, a trinket or symbol representing your cult, a piece of jewelry worth 10 gp, a hooded lantern, five flasks of oil, and a pouch containing 5 gp.</li>
			</ul>
			<div element="ID_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_CULT_SECRETS" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Whether you are a current or former member of a cult, your experiences have shaped you. As a follower, you are guided by deep-seated beliefs and rituals, while as a former member, your past continues to haunt you, and you may be driven by a desire for redemption or revenge</p>
