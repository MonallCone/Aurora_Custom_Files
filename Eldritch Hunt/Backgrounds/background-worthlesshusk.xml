		<description>
			<p>You were born into a world that saw you as utterly worthless, a waste of skin. Deemed talentless and devoid of potential, you were cast aside by those around you. As a Worthless Husk, you have learned to navigate the treacherous environment of the city, using your wits and endurance to survive. Given the chance to grow—a chance which you may never get—you could prove that even the most overlooked souls can make a difference in this twisted world.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>Stealth, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong>: A set of common clothes, a small rusted knife, a key to an important location, a pouch containing 1 gold piece </li>
			</ul>
			<div element="ID_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_BOTTOM_DWELLER" />
            <div element="ID_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_WORTHLESS" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Your life has been defined by neglect and devaluation. Deemed worthless by those around you, you've developed a grit and tenacity that allows you to thrive in the harshest conditions. Your perceived weakness could be your greatest strength, and in spite of your circumstances, you remain hopeful of proving your worth.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Having been discarded by society, you're familiar with desperation. You know the darkest corners of the city like the back of your hand. Whether it's the dank sewers, abandoned buildings, or the shadowy back alleys, you can navigate these places with ease and can often find shelter or a safe passage where others would see only squalor and danger. You require half as much food and water as a regular member of your race to survive, and have advantage on all Survival checks made to maintain a Wretched lifestyle. </p>

			<p>With your GM’s approval can pick this feature instead of Bottom Feeder. You are worthless, but you show a sliver of potential. When you choose this background at 1st level, reduce your highest ability score until the sum of your six ability scores is equal to 72 or fewer. Then, reduce each ability score by 1. When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2 or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 18 using this feature. </p>
