    <description>
      <p>Sloth Demons are creatures of languor and apathy, manipulating the threads of time, sleep, and fatigue. A Warlock who forms a pact with a Sloth Demon taps into the power of inefficiency, drowsiness, and indulgence. Their power comes not from haste, but from the slow unraveling of willpower and energy, weakening their enemies with lethargy and time. Through this pact, they become masters of debilitating magic, inducing exhaustion and controlling the flow of rest.</p>
