            <p>You use the blood within you as a conduit for whispered communication. You point to a willing creature within range and establish a mental connection with them. The target can hear your whispered message as though you were speaking directly into their mind. They can reply in a whisper that only you can hear, as long as they are within range.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell works only on creatures with blood and does not function on constructs, elementals, or the undead.</p>

When a creature enters the aura for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 necrotic damage and be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

            <p>You call upon the life force of an ally within 30 feet of you, draining it to fuel a devastating explosion of necrotic power. The chosen ally must have blood, but they do not need to be willing. The ally takes 50 hit points of necrotic damage, regardless of their current hit points, and may fall unconscious if the damage reduces them to 0 hit points. The pain and suffering from the blood sacrifice empower your magic, causing an eruption of dark energy.</p>

            <p>You perform a dark ritual, using a dagger as the focus of the spell. As you plunge the blade into your own flesh or the flesh of a nearby creature, blood spills from the wound, and you draw on the life force of those around you to power the ritual. The blood of the fallen and the wounded in the area is called forth, transforming into blood-red daggers that you control with a twisted will.</p>
            <p class="indent">A 40-foot radius around you becomes an area of death, where the blood of any creature that has taken damage in the past minute swirls and rises into the air. These blood-daggers are then shaped into sharp, deadly weapons, each one powered by the life force of the fallen. You send these daggers flying at a single target within range.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage for every creature within range that has less than its maximum hit points. The daggers shred through the target's body, each blade digging deep and causing the blood to pour from their wounds. The target is pinned to the ground by the daggers unless they succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC to break free.</p>
            <p class="indent">On a successful save, the target takes half damage and is not pinned.</p>

            <p>You conjure 3 fiery mines that hover in the air within range, each occupying a 5-foot square you can see. You must place these mines in unoccupied spaces adjacent to one another, forming a line, triangle, or square. The mines remain dormant until the start of your next turn. Once active, they detonate when a creature enters their space or ends its turn there. When a mine detonates, it explodes in a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Untriggered mines remain for 1 hour or until they detonate.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels: the damage dealt when the min detonates increase by 1d10 for every level above 2nd</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure 2 ice mines that hover in the air within range, each occupying a 5-foot square you can see. You can place these mines anywhere within range of the spell. The mines remain dormant until the start of your next turn. Once active, they detonate when a creature enters their space or ends its turn there. When a mine detonates, it explodes in a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 ice damage on a failed save reducing the creatures speed to 0 or half as much on a successful one with their movement unaffected. Untriggered mines remain for 1 hour or until they detonate.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create one additional mine for each slot level above 1st and an additional 5ft of range.</p>
