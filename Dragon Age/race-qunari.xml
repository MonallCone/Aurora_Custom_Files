			<p class="flavor">The Qunari are a towering, muscular race known for their strength, resilience, and unwavering discipline. Their culture follows the rigid and structured Qun, which governs their society with strict rules. Qunari are formidable fighters, with an intimidating presence and resistance to poison. Though powerful, they are wary of magic, particularly spells involving Charisma, which they view as a threat to their order.</p>
