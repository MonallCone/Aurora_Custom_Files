    <element name="Bag of Leeches" type="Magic Item" source="Homebrew" id="ID_HOMEBREW_BAG_OF_LEECHES">
        <description>
            <p>This damp, slimy bag is enchanted to summon leeches at dawn each day. The bag contains 1d10 <em>empty leeches</em>, which magically sustain themselves while inside the bag. Any leeches remaining at the next dawn, whether full or empty, shrivel up and die.</p>
            <p class="indent">An <em>empty leech</em> can be applied to a creature within 5 feet as an action. The leech drains <strong>1 hit point</strong> from the creature, becoming <em>full</em>. A <em>full leech</em> can then be fed to another creature within 5 feet as an action, restoring <strong>1 hit point</strong> to that creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">The bag can hold up to 10 leeches at a time. Excess leeches die if added to a full bag. Once removed from the bag, leeches can survive no longer than 24 hours, after which they perish regardless of their state.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the bag is pierced, torn, or otherwise damaged, its magic is destroyed, and it can no longer summon leeches.</p>
